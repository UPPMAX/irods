		    Scripts for managing iRODS servers
				January 2008


The iRODS distribution includes shell/Perl scripts to manage iRODS
after it has been installed (see INSTALL.txt).





1.  Start and stop the servers
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.1.  Starting the iRODS and database servers

Run:
	./irodsctl start

If the database server was configured as dedicated for iRODS use, this
will start the database server as well.

You can also start the iRODS and database servers individually:

	./irodsctl dbstart
	./irodsctl istart


1.2.  Stopping the iRODS and database servers

Run:
	./irodsctl stop

If the database server was configured as dedicated for iRODS use, this
will stop the database server as well.

You can also stop the iRODS and database servers individually:

	./irodsctl istop
	./irodsctl dbstop



1.3.  Restarting the iRODS and database servers

Run:
	./irodsctl restart

This is the same as running 'stop' then 'start'.

You can also restart the iRODS and database servers individually:

	./irodsctl irestart
	./irodsctl dbrestart



1.4.  Checking if the servers are running

Run:
	./irodsctl status

This lists the iRODS and database servers running, and their process IDs.





2.  Testing the servers
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run:
	./irodsctl test

This runs an extensive set of tests to be sure the installation is
working properly.  Normally, you do not need to run this.  It will
completely succeed only on the ICAT-Enabled Server host and only if a
number of default settings are used (resource names, etc).  A simple
iput, ils, and iget is also a good test of many aspects of the
installation.
