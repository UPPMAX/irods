To generate the Doxygen html document for the C APIs, type in:
    doxygen doxygen-api.config

The C APIs documentation can then be view through the file 
    lib/api/doc/html/index.html with a web browser.

To add a C API to the documentation, follow the following steps:

1) Add an entry to the lib/api/src/apiDoc.c file. The APIs are classified
into a number of categories. Enter the new API in the appropriate
category.

2) Document the API - Documentation for one of the API can be used as a
template. e.g., lib/api/src/rcDataObjOpen.c

Two blocks of comments are needed.
i) A block with the "@file" keyword at the top of the file. e.g.:
/**
 * @file  rcDataObjOpen.c
 *
 */
This instructs doxygen to 'compile' this file for documentation. Note that
the commnet block must start with "/**" 

ii) A block containing the documentation of the C API. e.g.,
/**
 * \fn rcDataObjOpen (rcComm_t *conn, dataObjInp_t *dataObjInp)
 *
 * \brief Open a data object. This is equivalent to open of UNIX.
   ....
   ....
   ....
 */

In addition, near the bottom of apiDoc.c contains a list of Input/Output
data structures used by the documented APIs. If the data structures used by 
this API is not on this list, add the missing data structures and document 
them.
