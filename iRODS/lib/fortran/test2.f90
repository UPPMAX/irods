program main

!
!  This is an example fortran program and that uses the iRODS Fortran I/O
!  library to do direct (thru the network) I/O to iRODS files.  See
!  the Makefile for how it is built.
!
!  The fortran I/O library functions have an _ at the end of their
!  names in the .c file, so that with many fortran compliers, the
!  linker will match up the functions as defined in here (for example,
!  'fio_setup' in this source file is 'fio_setup_' in the fortran_io.c
!  library).  There are other ways to do this (with -assume
!  nounderscore, or -fno-underscoring for example), so this can be
!  done differently if needed for your compiler.
