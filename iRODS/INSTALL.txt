		Introduction to iRODS scripts and configuration files
				January 2008


The iRODS distribution uses several configuration files and shell/Perl
scripts to build and manage the iRODS system.





1.  Installing iRODS using 'setup'
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install iRODS, execute the setup script in the iRODS home directory:

	./setup

The script prompts you for what to install and where to install it,
then does the job.  This typically takes 1/2 hour or more and is the
recommended way to install iRODS.

This script saves its work in two configuration files:

	install/installPostgres.config
		Used to configure a Postgres install.

	install/irods.config
		Used to configure the iRODS install.

Normally, there is no need for you to view or edit these files.  Both
files include comments that explain their settings.



1.1.  Installation options

iRODS is a flexible system that can be installed in several ways by
answering the prompts differently:

	* Install iRODS server, iCAT, commands, and Postgres
		The scripts download and install Postgres first,
		then build and configure iRODS to use that database.

		This is the recommended choice for new installs.


	* Install iRODS server, iCAT, and commands
		You will be prompted for information about an
		existing Postgres or Oracle database.  The scripts
		build and configure iRODS to use that database.


	* Install iRODS server, and commands
		You will be prompted for a host that is already
		running an iRODS server with iCAT support.  No
		new database is needed.  The scripts build and
		configure iRODS to access the other iRODS+iCAT
		server.


	* Install iRODS commands
		You will prompted for a host that is running an
		iRODS server.  No new server or database is needed.
		The scripts build and configure the commands to
		use that existing iRODS server.





2.  Installing iRODS without using 'setup'
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 'setup' script runs four steps for the installation that you can run
directly if needed:

	./installPostgres
		Download and build Postgres and ODBC distribtions.  Uses
		parameters in 'install/installPostgres.config'.  Saves
		parameters to 'install/irods.config'.

	./configure
		Configure the iRODS build.  Uses and saves parameters in
		'install/irods.config'.  Saves compilation parameters to
		'config/config.mk' and 'config/platform.mk'.

	make
		Build iRODS.  Uses configuration parameters in several
		include files in 'config/*.mk'.

	./setupFinish
		Install database tables and initialize iRODS.  Uses
		parameters in 'install/irods.config'.



2.1.  Installing with a new Postgres database

Edit 'install/installPostgres.config' to change defaults if needed.
See comments in the file.

Run:
	./installPostgres
	./configure
	make
	./setupFinish



2.2.  Installing with an existing Postgres database

Edit 'config/irods.config' and set:

	$DATABASE_TYPE = 'postgres';
	$DATABASE_ODBC_TYPE = 'unix';
	$DATABASE_HOME = '/path/to/postgres';
	$DATABASE_HOST = 'localhost';
	$DATABASE_PORT = '5432';
	$DATABASE_ADMIN_NAME = 'postgres-user-account';
	$DATABASE_ADMIN_PASSWORD = 'postgres-user-password';

The ODBC type must be "unix" for the unix ODBC, or "postgres" for the old
Postgres ODBC.  iRODS works best with the unix ODBC.

The Postgres database must be running on the same host as an iRODS
server with the iCAT enabled.  The iCAT stores metadata about the
catalog of archived files in the database.

iRODS can be configured with servers running on multiple hosts.  Only
one of those servers needs the iCAT enabled, so only one host needs
Postgres installed.  The other iRODS servers on other hosts can be
configured to communicate with the first iRODS server, its iCAT, and
the iCAT's Postgres database.

Run:
	./configure
	make
	./setupFinish

If the existing Postgres does not have the iCAT tables installed yet, the
'setupFinish' script will install them.  iRODS will coexist with other
uses of the same Postgres database.



2.3.  Installing with an existing Oracle database

Edit 'config/irods.config' and set:

	$DATABASE_TYPE = 'oracle';
	$DATABASE_HOME = '/path/to/oracle';
	$DATABASE_HOST = 'oracle-host-name';
	$DATABASE_PORT = 'oracle-port-number';
	$DATABASE_ADMIN_NAME = 'oracle-user-account';
	$DATABASE_ADMIN_PASSWORD = 'oracle-user-password';

The user account name must have the form 'schema@instance' per Oracle
conventions.

Run:
	./configure
	make
	./setupFinish

The 'setupFinish' script will install iCAT tables if needed.





3.  Managing an iRODS installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other documents discuss the iRODS tables, accounts, etc.  Here we only
discuss tasks under script control, including:

	* start and stop the iRODS and database servers
	* checking server status
	* testing the installation

These tasks are all done with the 'bin/irodsctl' script.



3.1.  Starting the iRODS and database servers

Run:
	bin/irodsctl start

If the database server was configured as dedicated for iRODS use, this
will start the database server as well.



3.2.  Stopping the iRODS and database servers

Run:
	bin/irodsctl stop

If the database server was configured as dedicated for iRODS use, this
will stop the database server as well.



3.3.  Restarting the iRODS and database servers

Run:
	bin/irodsctl restart

This is the same as running 'stop' then 'start'.



3.4.  Checking if the servers are running

Run:
	bin/irodsctl status

This lists the iRODS and database servers running, and their process IDs.



3.5.  Testing the iRODS installation

Run:
	bin/irodsctl test

This runs an extensive set of tests to be sure the installation is working
properly.





4.  Other iRODS scripts
------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are a few more scripts sysadmins may use if needed.



4.1.  Starting the iRODS server only

Run:
	server/bin/start

Be sure the database server, if needed, is already running.



4.2.  Stopping the iRODS server only

Run:
	server/bin/stop

The database server, if any, will be left running.



4.3.  Listing server processes

Run:
	perl server/bin/list.pl

This is a more detailed list of iRODS server processes than is
produced by 'bin/irodsctl status'.





5.  Uninstalling iRODS and Postgres
------------------------------------------------------------------------


5.1.  Dropping the iRODS tables

Stop the iRODS servers but leave the database server running, then
use the 'drop' option on 'irodsctl' to drop the database tables:

	server/bin/stop
	bin/irodsctl drop



5.1.  Uninstall Postgres as installed by iRODS

If you used the 'setup' or 'installPostgres' scripts to download and
install Postgres, then you can use the 'uninstallPostgres' script.
First stop the iRODS and database servers, then run the script:

	bin/irodsctl stop
	./uninstallPostgres

Optionally, if you don't plan on using Postgres again, delete your
'~/.pgpass' and '~/.odbc.ini' files.  Leave them there won't hurt
anything.



5.2.  Uninstall iRODS

Stop the servers and delete the iRODS home directory.  There are
no additional files in the rest of the OS.

	bin/irodsctl stop
	cd ..
	rm -rf the_irods_directory

Optionally, if you don't plan on using iRODS again, delete your
'~/.irods' directory.  Leaving it there won't hurt anything.
