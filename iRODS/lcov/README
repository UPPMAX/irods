'lcov' is a GNU tool which provides information about what parts of a 
program are actually executed (i.e. "covered") while running a particular 
test case. It is an extension of the 'gcov' tool.

To use 'lcov' for iRODS, please do the following:

1) Install the 'gcov' and 'lcov' tools

2) Compile and build the iRODS software with 'gcov' by uncommenting the line
  # USE_GCOV = 1
in config/platform.mk and rebuild the iRODS software (make clean;make).

3) Build the lcov html index:
  cd lcov
  ./lcovirods.csh clean	# start the coverage run from the beginning
  run tests (without any, the script below will just fail with no .gcda files)
  ./lcovirods.csh

4) To see the report, open ./data/index.html in a web browser.
Note that some browsers may not be able to properly open files outside
of the user's home directory.  When using 'pivo' (Ubuntu/Firefox) for
example, you may need to copy the data directory from the Tinderbox
build area (/tbox/IRODS_BUILD/iRODS).
