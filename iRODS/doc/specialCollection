Special collections are mounted collections. A file system or other
structured files can be mounted to a collection.

metadata:

3 collection metadata are used to define special collections. They are;

COL_COLL_TYPE, COL_COLL_INFO1 and COL_COLL_INFO2.

resolveSpecCollType() in ./core/src/rcMisc.c resolves the collection type
based on these 3 metadata.

The following definition in the objInfo.h file defines the collection types
(COL_COLL_TYPE):

#define HAAW_STRUCT_FILE_STR            "haawStructFile"
#define TAR_STRUCT_FILE_STR             "tarStructFile"
#define MOUNT_POINT_STR         "mountPoint"
Normal collection if COL_COLL_TYPE=""

1) COL_COLL_TYPE == MOUNT_POINT_STR ==>mounted file directory
COL_COLL_INFO1 = the mounted UNIX file directory
COL_COLL_INFO2 = the resource where this directory is located

2) COL_COLL_TYPE == TAR_STRUCT_FILE_STR ==> mounted tar file
COL_COLL_INFO1 = The path of the tar file
COL_COLL_INFO2 = caching info.  

COL_COLL_INFO1 and COL_COLL_INFO2 are normally important only to the server 
codes.

The queryCollInColl() function in miscUtil.c which queries for all 
sub-collections in a collection gives and an example of queries using these
3 metadata:

    addInxIval (&genQueryInp->selectInp, COL_COLL_TYPE, 1);
    addInxIval (&genQueryInp->selectInp, COL_COLL_INFO1, 1);
    addInxIval (&genQueryInp->selectInp, COL_COLL_INFO2, 1);
 

The rcQuerySpecColl is used to query (drip down) special (mounted) collections
int
rsQuerySpecColl (rsComm_t *rsComm, dataObjInp_t *dataObjInp,
genQueryOut_t **genQueryOut)

dataObjInp->objPath - path of the special collection
dataObjInp->openFlags - > 0 ==> continueInx 

genQueryOut contains COL_COLL_NAME, COL_DATA_NAME, COL_D_CREATE_TIME,
COL_D_MODIFY_TIME, COL_DATA_SIZE

if it is a collection, COL_DATA_NAME = ""
