How to add a microservice to iRODS
Sept 2007
------------------------------------------------------------------------

A "microservice" is a C function that executes within the iRODS servers.
Microservices are typically invoked through standard or user-defined
rules sent to the servers.





How to write a microservice
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Microservices must be written as C functions.  These functions take a list
of generic "msParam_t" arguments, and one "ruleExecInfo_t" argument at the
end.  The function returns an integer status code.  For example:

	int msiSample( msParam_t* arg1, msParam_t* arg2, ruleExecInfo_t* rei );

Authors are encouraged to name microservices with "msi" at the start.
For this and other naming conventions see the document
"NAME_CONVENTIONS.txt".

Each msParam_t provides a user-provided argument to the microservice, such
as the name of a data object or collection, a numeric value, a string flag
or option name, etc.  It's up to the microservice to define and parse its
arguments.

The ruleExecInfo_t provides a bundle information about the server.  A
principal component is rei->rsComm, which provides the communications link
to the server for logging messages and performing file operations.

How to add microservice source files to iRODS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Authors are encouraged to create a new module for custom microservices.
See the document "HOW_TO_ADD_A_MODULE.txt".

For iRODS system features, the microservices may be included in C source
files in the iRODS server/re/src directory.  To compile these services they
need to be listed in the server/Makefile.





How to add microservices to the iRODS server's action table
------------------------------------------------------------------------
All microservice functions are discovered by the iRODS server by reading
a master "action" table compiled into the server.  The action table is
split into three files:

	server/re/include/reAction.header
	server/re/include/reAction.table
	server/re/include/reAction.footer

The iRODS Makefiles assemble these files, and those provided by modules,
to build server/re/include/reAction.h.  That file contains:

	* reAction.header
	* The header for each microservice module.
	* reAction.table
	* The table entries for each microservice module.
	* reAction.footer

There are two ways to add a microservice:

	1. For system microservices:
		* Edit reAction.header to add function prototypes
		* Edit reAction.table to add table initializations

	2.  For module microservices:
		* Create MODNAME/microservices/include/microservices.header.
		* Edit this to add function prototypes.
		* Create MODNAME/microservices/include/microservices.table.
		* Edit this to add table initializations.

Function prototypes declare the C microservice function.  While these
can be added to the above files directly, authors are encouraged to use
a separate include file and just add a #include of that file.  For instance,
here's a typical microservices.header file for a module:

	// Sample module microservices
	#include "sampleMS.h"

The reAction.table and each module's microservices.table file contains a
C array initialization listing all available microservices.  Each line in
the initialization looks like this:

	// Sample module microservices
	{ "sample", 2, (funcPtr) msiSample },

There are three values, in order:

	1.  The service name is the user-visible name of the microservice.
	    It is a string using letters, numbers, and underbar.  It
	    should be descriptive and need not match the microservice
	    function name.

	2.  The argument count is the number of msParam_t arguments for the
	    function.  It does not include the ruleExecInfo_t argument.

	3.  The function name is a pointer to the C function for the
	    microservice.





How to rebuild reAction.h
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The server's reAction.h action table is rebuilt automatically by the iRODS
root Makefie if any include file in server/re/include or
modules/*/microservices/include changes.

To force reAction.h to be rebuilt, delete the existing file and run the
"reaction" Makefile target:

	rm server/re/include/reAction.h
	make reaction
