How to use a module's info.txt file
Sept 2007
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "info.txt" file in a module's top-level directory describes the module.
It is intended for use by the iRODS Makefiles and configuration scripts.

The file is a list of keyword-value pairs, one per line.  For instance:

	Name:		sample
	Brief:		A sample microservice module
	Description:	This is a sample module description.
	Dependencies:	example
	Enabled:	yes
	Creator:	University of California, San Diego
	Created:	Sept 2007
	License:	BSD


Name:
	The name of the module.  The name should match the module directory
	name.  (currently unused)

Brief:
	A brief half-line description of the module.  The iRODS configure
	script uses this value when printing help information about available
	modules.

Description:
	A longer description of the module.  While the value must be on a
	single line, it can be several sentences long.   (currently unused)

Dependencies:
	A list of module names upon which the module depends.  Names should
	be space-separated and must match module directory names.  The iRODS
	configure script uses this to insure that all modules that must be
	enabled together are enabled together.

Enabled:
	The value "yes" or "no" to indicate if the module should be enabled
	by default.  The iRODS configure script uses this to set defaults
	on configuring iRODS.

Creator:
	The name of the principal individual or organization responsible
	for creating the module.  (currently unused)

Created:
	The approximate creation date of the module.  (currently unused)

License:
	The license covering the module's source code.  Additional
	information may be in the source files or in module documentation.
	This value is only used as a general indicator.  (currently unused)
