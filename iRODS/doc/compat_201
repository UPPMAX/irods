In 2.1, some input API data structures regarding data object and 
collection operations have been consolidated into 3 : dataObjInp_t, 
openedDataObjInp_t and collInp_t. The consolidation makes it easier 
to write micro-services and helper routines for micro-services. 
The server can be configured to be backward compatible with 2.0.1 clients.

Configuring the server to support 2.0.1 clients
-----------------------------------------------
By default, the config/config.mk file is configured to enable the 
server to be compatible with 2.0.1 clients by setting the following
line in config/config.mk:

COMPAT_201=1

Commenting out the line will make the server to be incompatible with
with 2.0.1 clients.

Converting existing 2.0.1 client and micro-service C codes to 2.1
-----------------------------------------------------------------
For the rcDataObjRead and rsDataObjRead functions, replace dataObjReadInp_t
with openedDataObjInp_t. The elements in dataObjReadInp_t are compatible
with openedDataObjInp_t.

For the rcDataObjWrite and rsDataObjWrite functions, replace dataObjWriteInp_t
with openedDataObjInp_t. The elements in dataObjWriteInp_t are compatible
with openedDataObjInp_t.

For the rcDataObjClose and rsDataObjClose functions, replace dataObjCloserInp_t
with openedDataObjInp_t. The elements in dataObjCloserInp_t are compatible
with openedDataObjInp_t.

For the rcDataObjLseek and rsDataObjLseek functions, replace the input
fileLseekInp_t with openedDataObjInp_t. The elements in fileLseekInp_t are 
compatible with openedDataObjInp_t except one. All references to
dataObjLseekInp->fileInx should be replace with dataObjLseekInp->l1descInx.

For the rcCollRepl and rsCollRepl functions, replace dataObjInp_t
with collInp_t. The elements in dataObjInp_t are compatible with collInp_t 
except one. All references to collReplInp->objPth should be replace with 
collReplInp->collName.
