The following is the list of abbreviations we will use for the more
common terms.  Consistency throughout the code is important.

Collection     coll
Directory      dir    (as in mkdir, but same as a coll)
File(data obj) file
Register       reg
Resource       resc
Replica        repl
Logical        log
Physical       phys

We will also use common Unix abbreviations, such as mkdir, pwd, ls,
etc.

We are now calling the system iRODS, so the commands will be "i"
commands.  Sample icommands:

iregresc   Register resource
imkdir     Make directory
iinit      Initialize
iexit
ipwd
ils
ipwd
iput
iget
