A number of admin level iCat calls are needed for for users with 
LOCAL_PRIV_USER_AUTH privileges. For these calls, the only 
permission needs to be checked is :

rsComm->clientUser.authInfo.authFlag == LOCAL_PRIV_USER_AUTH

There is no need for checking specific permission for each individual file.

1) backup files - allow admin to make replica of files. This is a
special version of chlRegReplica.

2) Moving a data file from one resource to another. This is similar to
the chlModDataObjMeta call. The items being modified are data_path,
resc_name and resc_group_name, Currently, resc_group_name is not
an item that can be modified with the chlModDataObjMeta call. This
item need to be added to implement the iphymv command.

3) purging the cache copies - this allows admin to delete a replica as
long as there is another replica. This call should fail if this is the
last copy. This is similar to the chlUnregDataObj call except for
the special checking.

4) Delete files in trash. Allow admin users to delete files in the
/myZone/trash directory. This is similar to the chlUnregDataObj call.
