   I thought it will be useful for us to use the same name for some of the
   commonly used entities (such as collection, resource) in our code so
   that it will be easier to understand and cut and paste.


   item         	name in code            comment
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   user name    	userName                contains the foo@bar string
   rcat zone    	rodsZone                The zone
   collection   	collection
   data name    	dataName
   full Path    	logicalPath             collection/dataName
   repl number  	replNum                 the replication number
   resource     	resource                the name of the resource
   logical ressource	logResource		for places where the
   physical ressource	physResource		differentiation is needed
   resource loc 	resourceLoc             the resource location
   resource type   	resourceType            the resource type
   resource class  	resourceClass
   phys path    	physPath                the physical path
   Auth scheme  	authScheme              the authentication scheme


--------

We are also planning to have .rodsEnv and .rodsAuth files in a ~/.rods
subdirectory.

The .rodsAuth file will have the password (or a scrambled form) and if
it is not available, the Rinit command will prompt for the password.

The .rodsEnv file will contain values for:
  rodsHost
  rodsPort
  rodsHome
  rodsCwd
  rodsAuthScheme
  rodsDefResource
  rodsServerDn

Any one of these can be overridden by an environment variable by
the same name.

The parsing of the .rodsEnv file and handling of the environment
variables will be handled by a client library routine which will
create a structure with the values.  This structure will be passed to
the API routines.
