This file defines the list of first class objects (FCOs) about which 
information is stored in the RODS Catalog - also knows as RCAT.
These first class objects have unique identifiers and associated meta 
information. This file also  details these information.
This file also defines derived objects based on the FCOs and  ontologies
maintained by the RCAT system.


In version 1, we will keep the list of meta attributes to the minimum.


First Class Objects:
Note: All first class objects have internal identifiers. These identifiers are
all generated from the same sequence numbering scheme.
