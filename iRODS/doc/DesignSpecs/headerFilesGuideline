Guidelines for implementing  header files for rods.

When writing a module xyz.c, there should be a header file xyz.h
associated with it.

The xyz.h should contains all decorations assoicated with xyz.c including:

	1) #define
	2) typedef, enum, struct ... declorations
	3) macros
	4) prototypes of functions used in xyz.c

and probably some more.

That is, xyz.h will have everything that another modules need when
they are calling routines in xyz.

xyz.h will include all of the other include files that it depends on.
Each .h file will have #ifdefs and #defines so that if it is included
more than once, it will only be inserted once.  If xyz.c needs some
include files that outside callers do not (i.e. they need not be in
xyz.h), then those includes can go in the xyz.c source file.


All global variables for the server should be declared in:
	server/include/rsGlobal.h 
	server/include/rsGlobalExtern.h

and all global variables for the clientLib should be declared in:
        clientLib/include/rcGlobal.h 
        clientLib/include/rcGlobalExtern.h
