These are some notes on postgresql configuration for authentication.

pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf has line (from install):
  host all all 132.249.32.192 255.255.255.255 trust
which is needed for the ODBC connection to work.

There is also a default setting:
local   all         all                               trust
which the comments indicate are for Unix domain sockets, and
this applies to the psql command.

Each time you change pg_hba.conf you need to start and restart the
postgres server for it to take effect.

To use password authentication on the connection, I tried 
changing the host line to:
host all all 132.249.32.192 255.255.255.255 password
And then set the iRODS rodsDBUser and rodsDBUserPassword values in the
env file (or env variables) which do seem to be passed in OK.

I then set the password via sql:

For new users, the doc says:
CREATE USER foo WITH PASSWORD 'secret';
but since 'schroede' is created with the install, the command is:
alter user schroede with password 'secret';

However, I haven't actually been able to get this to work,
so I need to leave the line as:
host all all 132.249.32.192 255.255.255.255 trust
The username and password are being passed in OK, but the authentication
fails.

I wanted to try password (plain text transmission) and then try md5.
For now at least, and with postgres, using 'trust' is fine.
