Function and file naming conventions in iRODS
Sept 2007
------------------------------------------------------------------------

	** All naming conventions are recommendations only. **





Function names
------------------------------------------------------------------------
All C functions in iRODS occupy the same namespace.  To avoid function
name collisions, we recommend that:

	* Function names use multiple descriptive words.
		Example:  getMsParamByLabel

	* Function names use camel-case to distinguish words:
		Example:  printMsParam

	* Microservice function names start with "msi":
		Example:  msiDataObjGet

	* Microservice helper function names start with "mh":

	* Server function names start with "rs".

	* Client function names start with "rc".





File names
------------------------------------------------------------------------
General file purpose may be inferred by the location of the file in the
iRODS directory tree.  For instance, those in the server/re/src directory
are part of the rule engine, while those in the clients/icommands/src
directory are command-line tools.  Beyond this, we recommend that:

	* File names use multiple descriptive words.
		Example:  rodsServer.c contains the iRODS server
		main program.

	* File names reflect the names of functions in the file.
		Example:  msParam.c contains utility functions
		that work with the msParam struct.

	* File names use camel-case to distinguish words:
		Example:  irodsReServer.c

	* No two files in the same directory have names that
	  differ only by case.  This causes problems with
	  Windows and old Mac file systems.
