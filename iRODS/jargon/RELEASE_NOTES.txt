================================================================================================

Project: Jargon - IRODS Java API
Date: 10/01/2011
Release Version: Jargon 3.0.0
================================================================================================

News

This release is for the current 'classic' Jargon API, for release of iRODS 3.0.  This is differentiated from the newer 'Jargon-core' libraries which are now available and recommended.  

This 'classic' version of the API is supported, and the API will remain stable, as there are many implementations that depend on it.  Most of the 'new development' and new features activity
will be in Jargon-core.  To get the code, and for bug tracking and feature requests, please use the GForge page at: [[https://code.renci.org/gf/project/jargon/]]

For information on Jargon-core, go to the new GForge site, where you can check out the code, report and track issues, and find other information, including information on Maven artifacts 
available on the new RENCI Maven repository.

GForge for Jargon-core is at:  [[https://code.renci.org/gf/project/jargon/]]

There is a new GForge location for this Jargon 2.5 release.  The GForge project page for the 'classic' Jargon, which is called "Jargon-trunk' can be found at [[https://code.renci.org/gf/project/jargontrunk/]] Issue tracking, discussions, and feature requests are available.  Future releases of iRODS will include a move of the 'classic' Jargon code to git and Maven.  At this point the use of Bugzilla for Jargon issue tracking is deprecated.  As usual, issues can also be reported on the iRODS Chat group.
