libraries
---------

-gsi-classes.jar (packaged in lib directory)
-junit-4.7.jar (packaged in lib) - used by unit testing classes, not necessary for Jargon deployment
-mockito-all-1.8.4.jar - used for unit testing, not necessary for Jargon deployment

Features and Changes

*Jargon trunk changes and fixes are merged into this release

----------
*The old Jargon Gui, has been removed

-----------
*Support added for extensible metadata. Extensible metadata may be defined in the extended_icat_data_properties, or may be defined in an arbitrary
source that implements the ExtensibleMetaDataSource interface.  See classes in the org.irods.jargon.core.query package.  This involved significant revision
of GenQuery processing code.

----------
*Partial implementation of GenUpdate functionality, this will require additional work in IRODS2.3 before it is usable.

----------
*fix for Bug 79 -  fix resource validation in IRODSFile.setResource to not use file-based query

----------
* Work in progress to add easier/enhanced query using iquest syntax and returning a resultset object.  This is based on work 
in jargon-core, and should be treated as early access.  As the implementation moves forward in jargon-core, the genquery facilities
in the classic Jargon API will get a port of the new facility.

-----------
*added support and began adding unit tests using mock objects

-----------
Refactoring

*factoring classic GenQuery processing from IRODSCommands
*add IRODSServerProperties object that describes the connected-to server
*new irodsFunction() methods to prepare for factoring out packing instructions into individual implementation classes.
*other code cleanup activities

-----------
*Bug 94  - add mkdirs() to create intermediate files - added mkdirs() capability to IRODSfile

-----------
*Bug 103  - add mod avu capability

------------
*Bug 104  - long value in MetaDataRecordList
