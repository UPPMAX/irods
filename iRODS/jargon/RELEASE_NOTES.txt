Features and Changes

*Jargon trunk changes and fixes are merged into this release

----------
*The old Jargon Gui, has been removed

-----------
*Support added for extensible metadata. Extensible metadata may be defined in the extended_icat_data_properties, or may be defined in an arbitrary
source that implements the ExtensibleMetaDataSource interface.  See classes in the org.irods.jargon.core.query package.  This involved significant revision
of GenQuery processing code.

----------
*Partial implementation of GenUpdate functionality, this will require additional work in IRODS2.3 before it is usable.

----------
*fix for Bug 79 -  fix resource validation in IRODSFile.setResource to not use file-based query

----------
* Work in progress to add easier/enhanced query using iquest syntax and returning a resultset object.  This is based on work 
in jargon-core, and should be treated as early access.  As the implementation moves forward in jargon-core, the genquery facilities
in the classic Jargon API will get a port of the new facility.

-----------
*added support and began adding unit tests using mock objects

-----------
Refactoring

*factoring classic GenQuery processing from IRODSCommands
*add IRODSServerProperties object that describes the connected-to server
*new irodsFunction() methods to prepare for factoring out packing instructions into individual implementation classes.
*other code cleanup activities

-----------
*Bug 94  - add mkdirs() to create intermediate files - added mkdirs() capability to IRODSfile

-----------
*Bug 103  - add mod avu capability

------------
*Bug 104  - long value in MetaDataRecordList 

------------
*Bug 109 - NullPointerException possible from logging statement in IRODSMetaDataSet.java

------------
*Bug 110 - error when asking IRODSFile.exists with & in file name unit testing.  This is noted as an outstanding iRODS issue.  

------------
*made methods to retrieve misc server info public.

------------
*Bug 111 - Protocol exception returning binary (base64 encoded) data from execution of script 
Test cases, updated exec command method signatures to clean up unnecessary parms

-----------
*Resource allows add and delete of resource AVU metadata as well as list of resource metadata.  Beginning to add 'jargon-core' style code into the 
Jargon trunk.  Eventually, the two API will blend.

-----------
*added executeProxy() command to IRODSFileSystem that incudes hostname as a parameter

-----------
*Bug 113 - when there are three resources in the resource group, only two replicas are produced
Added new method in IRODSFile - replicateToResourceGroup(String resourceGroup)
Added a test.resource.group to the testing.properties file, and init code in the testsetup.sh file for unit testing of resource group command.

----------
*Bug 112 - query to get a resource AVU on a resource on an iRODS 2.3 using jargon 2.3
Added test case for proper usage in resource queries

----------
*Bug 114 - Bug 114 - performance of specific queries in Jargon 2.4 
Fixed ordering of AVU query components in GenQueryInp packing instruction sent to iRODS to avoid pathological SQL
