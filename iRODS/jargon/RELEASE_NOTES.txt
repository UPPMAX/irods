Features and Changes

----------
The old Jargon Gui, in org.sdsc.grid.gui, has been deprecated since Jargon 2.2, and will be removed in the release after this one 
 
----------
Compatibility testing with IRODS2.3
* expanded unit testing coverage and integration testing
* multi-thread testing for irodsfedora integration

----------
Beginning a 'first order' refactoring of Jargon, with an emphasis on breaking large classes into smaller, reusable components.
*extracted Tag processing in IRODSCommands to Tag
*created IRODSAvu and extracted AVU processing from ICommands
*broke up the IRODSCommands class into IRODSCommands and IRODSConnection
*removed unused edu.sdsc.grio.io.irods.Method class and removed previously deprecated references
*culled all TODO's and dead code, did mass format of source to bring it up to current standards.
*more refactoring to come.....

----------
Fix admin_build.xml ANT script to automatically compile with debug when running code coverage

----------
Replaced 'hand made' logging with standard logging, best practice for integrating with other frameworks, such as fedorairods
* to adjust logging, consult the log4j.properties file in src/api, defaults to ERROR, can be set to DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR
* this change supercedes the prior 'debug' conventions in Jargon

----------
Tests and resolution of Bug 32 -  copyTo when dest file is from URI results in -78000 resource not found

---------
Add a close() method to IRODSFile that will close the underlying IRODSFileSystem.  This is useful for occasions where the IRODSFile is created by a URI, 
where the IRODSFileSystem was not created in the calling code.  This was causing -4000 errors when the socket closed without a disconnect being sent.
A better solution will probably appear in newer versions of Jargon

---------
Tests and fix for Bug 57 -  parallel file get operation does not work in Jargon

---------
Resource enhancements to list, add resources to a resource group, and remove resources from a resource group for
enhancement request (Bug 62 -  resource group CRUD methods requested)

---------
Adding Maven support in parallel to main ANT build.  ANT is still the primary build mechanism, but Maven support is added to conveniently build a distro for working with Fedora and irodsfedora
code.  

(incomplete...work in progress)

---------
Support for 'no distinct' option, a new IRODS2.3 feature.  There are new methods in IRODSCommands, IRODSFile, and IRODSFile system that default to 'distinct' but have additional signatures
to override.

---------
Tests cases for Bug 68 -  error in checksum -12000 

---------
Testing cases for Bug 60 -  overwrite for file output stream - code in development
