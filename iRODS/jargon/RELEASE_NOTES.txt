Bug 27 -  In IRODSFileSystem, rule execution method always returns a String

-------------
Testing and fixes in progress for  Bug 27 -  In IRODSFileSystem, rule execution method always returns a String
Corrected response to CL_PUT_ACTION and CL_GET_ACTION, which was being invoked even when a client request was not being returned.
Adding new methods in IRODSFile and Rule to allow rules to be invoked with the rule as a String, as opposed to an InputStream.  Added a method
to return the rule invocation as a Map<String, String> as well as a Map<String, Object> based on user requests.
