/**
 * Classic API version of an access object.  This is an object that holds an <code>IRODSCommands</code> object that wraps a connection to IRODS.
 * These Access Objects are created via an <code>IRODSAccessObjectFactory</code> and rely on the synchronization of the <code>IRODSCommands</code> object
 * to coordinate access to the socket over which IRODS communicates.
 * 
 * NOTE: this is a design change under consideration, and should not yet be considered a stable part of the Jargon API.  This AccessObject strategy is meant
 * to transition to a newer Jargon API style under parallel development.
