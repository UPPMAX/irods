   * least one byte. If no byte is available because the stream is at end of
   * file, the value <code>-1</code> is returned; otherwise, at least one

   * any subsequent call to <code>read()</code> results in a
   * <code>IOException</code>, the exception is caught and treated as if it
   * were end of file; the bytes read up to that point are stored into
