  /**
   * Queries the file system to find all files that
   * match a set of conditions. For all those that
   * match, the fields indicated in the select array
   * are returned in the result object.
   *<P>
   * While condition and select array objects have all
   * been checked for self-consistency during their
   * construction, there are additional problems that
   * must be detected at query time:
   *<P>
   * <ul>
   *  <li>Redundant selection fields
   *  <li>Redundant query fields
   *  <li>Fields incompatible with a file system
   * </ul>
   *<P>
   * For instance, it is possible to build a condition
   * object appropriate for the Local system, then pass that object
   * in a local file system query. That will find that
   * the condition is incompatible and generate a mismatch
   * exception.
   *<P>
   * Query is implemented by the file-system-specific
   * classes, like that for the SRB, FTP, etc. Those
   * classes must re-map condition and select field names
   * and operator codes to those required by a particular
   * file system and protocol version. Once re-mapped,
   * they issue the query and get results. The results
   * are then mapped back to the standard public field
   * names of the MetaDataGroups. So, if a MetaDataGroup
   * uses a name like "file path", but the SRB calls it
   * "data name", then query maps first from "file path"
   * to "data name" before issuing the query, and then
   * from "data name" back to "file path" within the
   * results. The programmer using this API should never
   * see the internal field names.
   *
   * @param conditionArray The conditional statements that describe
   *    the values to query the system, like WHERE in SQL.
   * @param selectArray The attributes to be returned from those values that
   *     met the conditions, like SELECT in SQL.
