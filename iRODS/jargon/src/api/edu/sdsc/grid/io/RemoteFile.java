/**
 * An abstract representation of file and directory pathnames on a
 * remote server.
 * This abstract class can be subclassed to create a file object
 * for refering to a remote file on a particular kind fo remote server.
 *<P>
 * Shares many similarities with the java.io.File class:
 * User interfaces and operating systems use system-dependent pathname
 * strings to name files and directories. This class presents an abstract,
 * system-independent view of hierarchical pathnames. An abstract pathname
 * has two components:
 *<P>
 * An optional system-dependent prefix string, such as a disk-drive specifier,
 * "/" for the UNIX root directory, or "\\" for a Microsoft Windows UNC
 * pathname, and
 *<br>
 * A sequence of zero or more string names.
 * Each name in an abstract pathname except for the last denotes a directory;
 * the last name may denote either a directory or a file. The empty abstract
 * pathname has no prefix and an empty name sequence.
 * The conversion of a pathname string to or from an abstract pathname is
 * inherently system-dependent. When an abstract pathname is converted into
 * a pathname string, each name is separated from the next by a single copy
 * of the default separator character. The default name-separator character
 * is defined by the system property file.separator, and is made available
 * in the public static fields separator and separatorChar of this class.
 * When a pathname string is converted into an abstract pathname, the names
 * within it may be separated by the default name-separator character or by
 * any other name-separator character that is supported by the underlying
 * system.
 *<P>
 * A pathname, whether abstract or in string form, may be either absolute or
 * relative. An absolute pathname is complete in that no other information is
 * required in order to locate the file that it denotes. A relative pathname,
 * in contrast, must be interpreted in terms of information taken from some
 * other pathname. By default the classes in this package always resolve
 * relative pathnames against the current user directory. This directory is
 * named by the system property user.dir, and is typically the directory in
 * which the Java virtual machine was invoked.
 *<P>
 * The prefix concept is used to handle root directories on UNIX platforms,
 * and drive specifiers, root directories and UNC pathnames on Microsoft
 * Windows platforms, as follows:
 *<P>
 * For UNIX platforms, the prefix of an absolute pathname is always "/".
 * Relative pathnames have no prefix. The abstract pathname denoting the root
 * directory has the prefix "/" and an empty name sequence.
 *<P>
 * For Microsoft Windows platforms, the prefix of a pathname that contains a
 * drive specifier consists of the drive letter followed by ":" and possibly
 * followed by "\" if the pathname is absolute. The prefix of a UNC pathname
 * is "\\"; the hostname and the share name are the first two names in the
 * name sequence. A relative pathname that does not specify a drive has no
 * prefix.
 *<P>
 * Instances of the RemoteFile class are immutable; that is, once created,
 * the abstract pathname represented by a RemoteFile object will never change.
 *<P>
