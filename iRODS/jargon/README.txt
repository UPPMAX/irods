To build Jargon:

1) Download JVM from SUN (other versions of java do not seem to work).
2) cd jargon; ant build

To test jargon

1) set up the ~/.irods/.irodsEnv file (same as the icommand) and put the
plain text password in the ~/.irods/.irodsA file (scrambled password does
not work).
2)run the run_irods or run_irods_fulltest (for the full test) ANT tasks
