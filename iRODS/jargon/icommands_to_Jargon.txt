  ilsresc       - List resources
  imiscsvrinfo  - Get basic server information; test communication. 
  iuserinfo     - List users

Administration:
  iadmin        - Administration commands: add/remove/modify users, resources, etc. 

Rules and Delayed rule execution:
  iqdel         - Removes delayed rules from the queue.
