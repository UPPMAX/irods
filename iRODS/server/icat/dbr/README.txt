This directory contains some examples and documention related to the
Database Resources (DBRs) and Database Objects (DBOs).  The iRODS
DBR/DBO facility is separate from the ICAT database, but both
interface into Database Management Systems (DBMSes) and use some
common lower-level code.

This directory contains two DBOs that serve as examples and can also
be useful additions to a DBR/DBO environment.  Each one lists the
tables defined within a DBR.  One version is for Postgresql and the
other for Oracle.  See the comments at the head of each for more
information.  Also see the 'Database Resources' page on the irods web
site.
