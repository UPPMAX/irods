DIRECTORY
        iRODS/server/test/procedures - Server manual test procedures

DESCRIPTION

        This directory contains descriptions of some manual test
        procedures that exercise and test some of the core
        functionality.  Automated tests, such as 'irodsctl devtest'
        cover much, but these manual tests are more difficult to set
        up and so are not (yet) part of automated testing.  But we
        expect to be able to perform many of these in the RENCI Hudson
        test system in the near future.

        These are primarily useful during development and are not
        a verification suite.
