For this test, we will enable and exercise the OS Auth mode.

I normally run irods under user 'schroeder'.  My test secondary unix
user login for this test is 'wayne'.

Edit config/config.mk, uncomment:
# OS_AUTH = 1
to be
OS_AUTH = 1
And change:
OS_AUTH_KEYFILE = /etc/irods.key
to be:
OS_AUTH_KEYFILE = /tmp/irods.key

Create /tmp/irods.key as a text file and edit it to add some random
characters.  (Since this is only a test, it doesn't have to be secure.)

make

irodsctl restart

iadmin mkuser wayne rodsuser
(Don't set a password tho, it's not needed.)

su wayne
As user wayne:
 
  set up a normal irods user environment (password auth) and path to
  the i-commands.

  ils
  (should get an error)

  export irodsAuthScheme=OS
  ils
  (should list the empty home collection)

  ls > f1
  iput f1
  irm -f f1
  (should also work fine)

  exit
