For this test, we will use the ICAT postgres instance and the ICAT
Database as the database resource (DBR) (note that we recommend
against using doing this in production but can do so as a test).

The ICAT host is 'zuri.ucsd.edu'.
Postgres is being used for the ICAT.
Postgres was installed in /home/schroeder/pg/pgsql.
The DBR will be called 'dbr1'.

As the irods admin user, update ~/.odbc.ini file to have:
[IRODS_DBR_dbr1]
Driver=/home/schroeder/pg/pgsql/lib/libodbcpsql.so.2.0.0
Debug=0
CommLog=0
Servername=zuri.ucsd.edu
Database=ICAT
ReadOnly=no
Ksqo=0
Port=5432

Edit server/config/dbr.config adding:
dbr1 schroeder abcdef postgresql
where 'abcdef' is the database password

Edit config/config.mk
Uncomment:
#DBR=1
to be
DBR=1
and check the lines below that for accuracy.

make

irodsctl restart

iadmin rmresc dbr1   (to remove existing dbr1, if it exists)
iadmin mkresc dbr1 database postgresql zuri.ucsd.edu

ichmod -R own rods dbr1

cd server/icat/dbr
iput lt.pg 
isysmeta mod lt.pg datatype 'database object'
isysmeta ls -l lt.pg 

idbo exec dbr1 lt.pg
(should get a list of the tables)

idbo exec dbr1x lt.pg
(should get an error message)

idbo exec dbr1 file1
(should get an error message)

idbo
output dbo1
exec dbr1 lt.pg
quit
(output should be written to irods file dbo1)
