This is a test of some data movement functionality via the dataTest.pl
script.  It uses 3 resources that can be on multiple hosts to test
various transfers modes (by default, demoResc, demoResc2, and
demoResc3).  Some of the files are large to exercise that mode of
transfer.  It uses iput, itrim, irepl, irm, imkdir, and imkdir.  See
the script for more information.

The local host is zuri.ucsd.edu, substitute your own.
The local vaults were under /home/schroeder/vault, substitute your own.
For some tests, pivo.ucsd.edu and /home/schroeder/vault were used,
substitute your own.

1) Setup three resources on the local host and test

Install iRODS via irodssetup.
After the default irodssetup, demoResc is defined already.

Make sure the icommands are in the path and 'iinit' has been run.

iadmin mkresc demoResc2 'unix file system' archive zuri.ucsd.edu /home/schroeder/vault_2

iadmin mkresc demoResc3 'unix file system' archive zuri.ucsd.edu /home/schroeder/vault_3

cd server/test/bin
./dataTest.pl
(Takes about 3 minutes, should complete with 'Success')

2) Set up a non-ICAT Enabled Server on another host, moving demoResc2 to it.

iadmin rmresc demoResc2

Run irodssetup or some other way create a non-IES on the 2nd host. By
default, irodssetup will create demoResc2.

2a) run dataTest.pl on the IES
(With the network transfers, it will take longer than test 1.)

2b) log into the non-IES and run dataTest.pl.  
By default, this will have the user environment set up to talk to the
non-IES as the initial connection, which is what we want as this tests
somewhat different communications logic.

3) Repeat 2, moving demoResc from the IES to the non-IES

demoResc must be empty.

iadmin rmresc demoResc
iadmin mkresc demoResc 'unix file system' archive pivo.ucsd.edu /home/schroeder/vault

dataTest.pl

4) Repeat 2 and/or 3 using using platforms of different architecture
types, Ubuntu and Mac for example.
