# This is an example of an input for the irule command for
# testing the msiDboExec micro-service.  Run via irule -F
# This first input line is the rule body
# The second input line is the input parameter in the format of 
# label=value. e.g., *A=/temp/home/rods/foo1
# Multiple inputs can be specified using the '%' character as the separator.
# The third input line is the output description. Multiple outputs can be
# specified using the '%' character as the separator.    
#
# For testing, I was using an ICAT db (which normally one should not) and
# the dbo7 contained these lines (without the # to comment them):
#select user_name, zone_name from r_user_main where zone_name = ?
#user_name=%s zone_name=%s
