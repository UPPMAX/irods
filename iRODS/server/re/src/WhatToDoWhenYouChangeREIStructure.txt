When the RuleExecInfo Structure is modified 
in reGlobalsExtern.h, the following functions need to be modified
to enable compatibility to the redefined structure.we need to change the
copy and free routines for this structure.  This is a pain,
and hopefully we will be able to automate this in the future.

Also, if any structure in the RuleExecInfo Structure has its
definition changed then  the maintennace routine need to be
changed. 

When the RuleExecInfo Structure is modified 
in reGlobalsExtern.h, the following functions need to be modified
to enable compatibility to the redefined structure. This is a pain,
and hopefully we will be able to automate this in the future.

In file reStruct.c 
 
 1. modify function copyRuleExecInfo
 2. modify function freeRuleExecInfoStruct

In file reVariableMap.c

 1. modify function getValFromRuleExecInfo



When the definition of an internal structure used in the
RuleExecInfo Structure is modified, corresponding Get statements
also need to be modified in the file reVariableMap.c
IMPORTANT, this applies to any sub or sub-sub... structure
that is changed underneath :-(

For example assume that the collInfo_t struct is modified (objInfo.h)
Then the following related functions need to be changed also to reflect 
those changes:
In file reStruct.c 
 
 1. modify function copyColljInfo
 2. modify function freeCollInfo

In file reVariableMap.c

 1. modify function getValFromCollInfo

Note that some of these functions may not be in reStruct.c or 
reVariableMap.c but elsewhere.
