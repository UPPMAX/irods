# HostAccessControl - The host based access configuration file.
#                     It is used only if the following hook is commented out in your core.irb:
                      acChkHostAccessControl||msiCheckHostAccessControl|nop
#
# The first column specifies a user that is allowed to connect to
# this iRODS server. An entry of "all" means all users are allowed.
# The second column specifies the group name. An entry of "all" means, all groups are allowed.
# The third and fourth columns specify the address and the address mask.
# Together, they define the client IP addresses/domains that are permitted
# to connect to the iRODS server. The address column specifies the IP
# address and the Mask column specifies which bits that will be ignored. 
# i.e., after those bits are taken out, the connection address 
# must match the address in the address column.
#
# <name>   <group>   <address>     <mask>

#all all 127.0.0.1 255.255.255.255
