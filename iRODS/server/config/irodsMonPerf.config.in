# The configuration file irodsMonPerf.config is used by the monitoring and load balancing system.
# If you want to monitor all your physical resources, it is not needed.
# If you want to monitor only a subset of servers, then you should:
#        1- rename this file irodsMonPerf.config.in into irodsMonPerf.config
#        2- list them below: 1 server per line. # is for commented lines.
