# This is the optional host configuration file for configuring the
# equivalent host address used by the iRODS server. The server uses
# the gethostbyname() call to get the network address of each host but
# this call may not be able to get all the special network addresses
# configured for this host. In this case, a line should be added in
# this file for each host that requires clarification. Each line
# should list all the hostnames and addresses (separated by spaces)
# for a given host. If the host is the local host, the first entry
# must be the keyword "localhost" followed by all the local host
# addresses,
# e.g. :
# localhost foo.sdsc.edu srbbrick7
