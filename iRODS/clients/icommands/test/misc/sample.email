Raja:
I would like to include in the tutorial two slides on how to compose 
services.  I need one slide that describes how to pass parameters 
between micro-services.
I need a slide that describes how to write parameters to the 
whiteboard and retrieve them.

I have a list of icat attribute names, and the wiki lists the 
mico-services.  Is there an easy way to understand the input and 
output parameters for each micro-service.  I suppose we could look at 
the C code for each mico-service,

Thanks,
Reagan
