For Installation and Use of of the Client Utilities:
 a. In the following, we assume that a SRB Client has been 
	compiled successfully on a host machine. 
    In the discussion, we call this host machine as SRBCLNTHOST.
    The directory where CL utilities reside is called CLUTILDIR.
 b. We call the commands that can be issued as Client Utilities 
	as Scommands (all of them start with an uppercase S).
 
(1) To install run make on Makefile in CLUTILDIR. You may have 
	to change some of the variables in Makefile for linking 
	with the SRB client library package.

(2) To run any of the Client Utilities, one needs to have three
	environment files. These files should be located in
	the directory .srb in  your home directory.
	(a) ~/.srb/.MdasAuth  - This file contains the MCAT password
				for the current user. The user name
				is picked up from the Unix/Unicos 
				operating system. More information is given
				in the README file of SRB.
	    			A sample .MdasAuth file is given below:
------------------------- .MdasAuth -----------------------
#Mdas-SRB Password - this is a comment line
password
------------------------- .MdasAuth -----------------------

	(b) ~/.srb/.MdasEnv   - This file contains information for
				initializung the SRB client environment.
				When running in any Unix shell, a new, unique
				copy of the file is created for its use.
				The file contains the home collection name 
				in the mdas collection structure for the user.
				IT also contains the domain name for the user 
				along with the user's name, host where 
				SRBMaster is located and the port number of
				the SRBMaster through which the client will
				make connections to talk to SRBMaster.
				Each user should change this file to reflect
				their environment.
				A sample .MdasEnv file is given below:
------------------------- .MdasEnv ------------------------
mdasCollectionName 'srbtest'
mdasCollectionHome 'srbtest'
mdasDomainName 'sdsc'
mdasDomainHome sdsc'
srbUser 'sekar'
srbHost 'mda-18.sdsc.edu'
srbPort '5553'
------------------------- .MdasEnv ------------------------

	(c) ~/.srb/.MdasDefResources - This file contains default values for
				some resources that a user wants to be used
				as a default when using the utilities.
				Currently, the file is unused.

(3) Everytime, you use the Client Utilities, from a new shell,
	run 'Sinit' to initialize the environment and to check
	connection with SRBMaster. Running Sinit in the middle
	of a session will reset the client enviromental file 
	variables.
(4) Use Sexit when finished with using Scommands.

(5) Use Serror to find the meaning of error numbers generated 
	when running Scommands.

(6) Man pages for Scommands are in directory CLUTILDIR/man.
	Set MANPATH appropriately to see the man pages.
