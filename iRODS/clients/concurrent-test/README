## The Beginning of a Mega Collection of tests designed to pound,
## hammer, bludgeon and just generally test the heck out of iRODS.

Invoke the test like so:

./poundtests.sh <numtests>

In the ResourcesToTest file, list your resources, one per line.  Currently no comments are allowed in this file.

The above will initiate 3 consecutive tests pounding on
the resources listed in the ResourcesToTest file

Currently, 'poundtests' only calls the 'putget' script.
For each test subdirectory created in 'poundtests', putget puts
an individual file, adds meta data, mv's the files to another
irods directory, get's the same file and compares the meta data.

The subdirectories created by poundtests are created on the fly.
They are:

zerofiles - contains 1000 zero length files  
smallfiles - contains 100 smallish (32byte or something) files
bigfiles - contains 10 big files

The 'bigfile' I used is simply a binary from /usr/bin/ cat'd to
itself many times.  This is not optimal.  I need to figure out
how to write a big ol' binary file on the fly in a shell script.

If putget has any trouble getting or retrieving anything it
bails and so does poundtest.
