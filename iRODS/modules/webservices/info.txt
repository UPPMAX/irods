Brief:		Microservices for accessing webservices
Description:	Microservices for providing access to web services
                It uses gsoap to make the libraries. These libraries
                need to be built first and moved into lib directory
                along with other needed include files
                before the microservices are compiled and linked.
                See HELP.txt for more details.
