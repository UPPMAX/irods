I believe this is the iExplore source tree, the replacement for inQ.
It is a Microsoft .net project and can be built only with .net studio
2005 and up.  iExplore has been released for our major versions of
iRODS and can be downloaded from our irods web site.

Bing Zhu gave me a copy of this directory in early December 2010 soon
after he resigned from the DICE-UCSD team (and left UCSD).  This was
on his laptop but not in SVN.  He suggested I commit it as a separate
iExp subtree like this.  I believe this is based on inQ, but with
substantial changes.
