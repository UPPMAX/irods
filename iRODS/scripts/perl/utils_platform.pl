# Platform functions used by iRODS perl scripts.

# Usage:
# 	require scripts/perl/utils_platform.pl
#
# Dependencies:
#	scripts/perl/utils_paths.pl
#	scripts/perl/utils_print.pl
#
# The functions in this file either (a) detect host platform
# features, or (b) invoke those features.  In either case, they
# cover up some platform-dependencies and enable other scripts
# to be more generic.
#
# Platform dependencies values include getting the name of the OS,
# the user, the processor type, and particularly the host name
# and IP addresses.

#
# Design Notes:  getting host attributes
#	Determining OS and host-specific features has to be done
#	without actually using OS-specific features.  For example,
#	we can't use a UNIX command to determine if we are on UNIX!
#
#	Instead, we try to use built-in Perl features wherever
#	possible, and only fall back to external commands when
#	nothing else is available.  However, while Perl has many
#	modules for this sort of thing, we can only use features
#	built into Perl or in the standard Perl distribution.
#	Optional modules may not be installed on this host, so
#	we can't use them.
#
#	The POSIX module *is* standard and provides the uname()
#	function, which is similar to the UNIX uname command.  The
#	function returns:
#		$sysname  = OS name.
#		$nodename = host name.
#		$release  = OS release number.
#		$version  = OS version number.
#		$machine  = processor class.
#
#	The same values are returned by the uname command:
#		uname -s  = OS name.
#		uname -r  = OS release number.
#		uname -v  = OS vedrsion number.
#		uname -n  = host name.
#		uname -m  = processor class.
#		uname -p  = processor type.
#
#	Notices that the command's -p (processor type) has no
#	equivalent in the uname() function.  Sample results:
#
#	Linux (RedHat):
# 		sysname		Linux
# 		nodename	qe2
# 		release		2.4.21-51.Elsmp
# 		version		#1 SMP Wed Jul 25 03:27:17 EDT 2007
# 		machine		i686
#		(uname -p	i686)
#
#	Linux (Ubuntu):
# 		sysname		Linux
# 		nodename	whatever
# 		release		2.6.15-29-386
# 		version		#1 PREEMPT Mon Sep 24 17:18:25 UTC 2007
# 		machine		i686
#		(uname -p	unknown)
#
#	Mac OS X (Intel):
# 		sysname		Darwin
# 		nodename	Cantaga.local
# 		release		9.1.0
# 		version		Darwin Kernel Version 9.1.0: Wed Oct 31 17:46:22 PDT 2007; root:xnu-1228.0.2~1/RELEASE_I386
# 		machine		i386
#		(uname -p	i386)
#
#	Mac OS X (PPC):
# 		sysname		Darwin
# 		nodename	fileserver
# 		release		8.10.0
# 		version		Darwin Kernel Version 8.10.0: Wed May 23 16:50:59 PDT 2007; root:xnu-792.21.3~1/RELEASE_PPC
# 		machine		Power Macintosh
#		(uname -p	powerpc)
#
#	Solaris:
# 		sysname		SunOS
# 		nodename	multivac
# 		release		5.9
# 		version		Generic_118558-37
# 		machine		sun4u
#		(uname -p	sparc)
#
#	Note that $sysname is reliable for the OS name
#	("Darwin" = Mac OS X).  $nodename is no better than other
#	methods to get the host name.  $release and $version are
#	too illdefined to be very useful.
#
#	$machine works to get a rough processor class, but don't
#	depend upon it with much precision.  For example, on a Mac
#	running Mac OS X, $machine is "i386", but on the *same* Mac
#	with Ubuntu Linux via Parallels virtualization, $machine
#	is now "i686".
#
#	Also note that 'uname -p' is *not* a reliable way to get
#	the processor type.  On Ubuntu Linux, it returned "unknown",
#	when $machine was "i686".
#
#
# Design Notes:  caching
#	Separately, some of these functions are expensive.  They may
#	run external commands, which require starting up a shell.  To
#	save time, many of these functions cache the results from a
#	first call and simply return it on subsequent calls.
#
#
# Design Notes:  finding external commands
# 	The user's $PATH may not include the commands we want.  To
# 	be safer, the findCommand() function here looks in $PATH,
# 	and then onwards through standard UNIX directories to find
# 	a desired command.  Other functions that run such commands
# 	use findCommand() to find the path to it.
#





# Make sure the paths utility script has been loaded.
